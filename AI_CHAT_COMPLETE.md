### 🎊 **Try These Example Conversations:**

**Attendance Status Check:**
```
You: "What's my attendance looking like?"
AI: "Based on your data, you currently have 75.3% attendance across all subjects. Your strongest areas are Math (90%) and Networks (87%), while History (44%) and Environmental Studies (43%) need attention. Would you like specific strategies for improvement?"
```

**Strategy Planning:**
```
You: "How can I optimize my attendance strategy?"
AI: "Given your preferences for Math, Networks, and ML, I recommend attending ALL classes in these subjects while strategically managing attendance in disliked subjects. You can achieve 78.3% overall attendance by attending 408/460 remaining classes, saving 78 hours for other priorities."
```

**Personalized Motivation:**
```
You: "I'm struggling to attend morning classes"
AI: "I understand morning classes can be challenging! Based on your data, you prefer 9-12 PM slots. Try scheduling your favorite subjects (Math, Networks) during these preferred times. Also, consider your goal of maintaining good grades in subjects you love - each class attended builds toward that success!"
